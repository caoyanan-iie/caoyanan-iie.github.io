I am a research fellow & professor of Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences(IIE, CAS), supervising Ph.D. programs in the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences(UCAS) as well. I had received my bachelor's degree in the School of Computer Science and Technology of Shandong University(SDU) in 2006 and my Ph.D. in the Institute of Computing Technology of, Chinese Academy of Sciences(ICT, CAS) in 2012. My research interests are about natural language processing(NLP), social network analysis(SNA) and machine learning(ML), including knowledge map construction & reasoning, text generation, graph neural network and so on. 

Working in the CAS for over a decade, I obtained some compressive awards like the youth star/excellent teacher/exceptional supervisor and so on. With persistent hardwork, I was selected into the Youth Innovation Promotion Association of the CAS. In the aspect of academic competitions, I had won the first place in the Astar program of Baidu Co., Ltd. in 2017, the third place in the OAG-WHOISWHO competition in 2019 and the BSET PAPER award in PAKDD 2020. Up to now, numerous academic papers have published in top international conferences and journals including WWW, AAAI, ICDM and CIKM, and has published over than sixty papers indexed by EI and SCI. I have served as a member of ACL, AAAI, EMNLP, CIKM program committee and IJCAI senior program committee for many years. At the meanwhile, I am a peer reviewer of academic journals at home and abroad such as TKDE, TIS, FCS, Journal of Computer Science and Technology, Journal of Chinese Information Processing, and serves as a review expert of National Natural Science foundation of China and Beijing Municipal Natural Science Foundation. 

For engineering application, I has presided over and participated in a number of projects supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China, National Key Research and Development Project of China, Strategic Priority Research Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, and accumulated a wealth of research & project experience. 

On campus, I am the lecturer of "Deep Learning and Natural Language Processing" and "Intelligent Question Answering Frontier Technology" courses for postgraduate program in the UCAS and all my students feel comfortable in my light-hearted and humorous style.
